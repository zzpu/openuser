title: Getting Cookies to Work on Multi-Domains
---

ORY Kratos' browser features rely heavily on HTTP Cookies to mitigate common
attack vectors and make the integration as easy as possible to use. Therefore it
is important to know that

1. [HTTP Cookies ignore ports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1612177/are-http-cookies-port-specific),
   meaning the browser will send a cookie it received for
   `http://my-domain.com:1234` to `http://my-domain.com:4321` as well.
2. [Subdomains can set HTTP Cookies for parent domains](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain),
   meaning a HTTP Cookie specifying `domain=my-domain.com` will be allowed to
   set even if the URL is `http://sub.my-domain.com` or
   `http://sub.sub.my-domain.com`.

You can adjust the session cookie's domain using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    domain: my-domain.com
```

What **is not** currently possible is to set up ORY Kratos in a way where you
get session cookies running on two separate top level domains (e.g.
`my-domain.com` and `another-domain.com`). This is tracked as
[kratos#662](https://github.com/zzpu/openuser/issues/662).
