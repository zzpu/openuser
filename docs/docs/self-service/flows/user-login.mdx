:::information

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

There are two Login Flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The Login Flow can be summarized as the following state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: Execute Before Login Hook(s)
  s3: User Interface renders Login Flow Forms
  s4: Execute After Login Hook(s)
  s5: Update Login Flow with Error Context(s)
  s6: Login successful
	[*] --> s1 : User clicks "Log in"
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> Error : A hook fails
  s2 --> s3
  s3 --> s4 : User provides valid credentials data
  s3 --> s5 : User provides invalid credentials data
  s5 --> s3
  s4 --> Error : A hook fails
  s4 --> s6
  s6 --> [*]
  Error --> [*]
`}
/>

Currently, two login methods are supported:

- `password` for signing in with an email / username and password;
- `oidc` for signing in using a social sign in provider such as Google or
  Facebook (check out the
  [set up guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin.mdx)).

Both are dis/enabled in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      # ...
```

## Initialize Login Flow

The first step is to initialize the Login Flow. This allows pre-login hooks to
run, set up Anti-CSRF tokens, and more.

### Login for Browser Clients

The Login Flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between ORY Kratos,
your Login UI, and the end-user's browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['login']}
  success="Set session cookie"
  interactions={['"Log in"']}
/>

To initialize the Login Flow, point the Browser to the initialization endpoint:

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Login UI, appending the
`?flow=<flow-id>` query paremeter (see the curl example) to the URL configured
here:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    login:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login
```

### Login for API Clients

<ApiWarning />

The Login Flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be summarized
as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['login']}
  success="Return login session token"
  interactions={['"Log in"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization
endpoint
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#initialize-login-flow-for-api-clients))
which returns a JSON response:

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

## Login Flow Payloads

Fetching the Login Flow
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#get-login-flow)) is usually only
required for browser clients but also works for Login Flows initializied by API
clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

<CodeTabs items={getFlow} />

### Login with Username/Email and Password

:::tip Before you start

Please read the
[Username / Email & Password Credentials Documentation](../../concepts/credentials/username-email-password)
first.

:::

When the `password` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload
in the Login Flow:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/login/flows?id=26ac2d66-eeb7-42f3-8ba8-5fe70925d6a3' \
  | jq -r '.methods.password.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=26ac2d66-eeb7-42f3-8ba8-5fe70925d6a3",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "identifier",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "value": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "type": "password",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "Bo72oeXYFnjZj2B9Ple+GZBkn5oqQZDACcYvGeUi8J48R9+yRk1KBagov/nJ/jbfBgugsMUzYMf4VpGNThkjgw=="
    }
  ]
}
```

### Login with Google, Facebook, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

:::tip Before you start

Check out the
[Sign in with GitHub, Google, ... Guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin.mdx)
and learn how to set up this method!

:::

The Social Sign In Method (`oidc`) enables you to use

- [GitHub](http://github.com/);
- [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/);
- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in);
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/);
- [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra);
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org);
- and every other OpenID Connect Certified Provider

:::warning

Social Sign In is currently not possible for API Clients. It will be possible in
a future version, which is partially tracked as
[kratos#273](https://github.com/zzpu/ums/issues/273)

:::

If enabled, the method contains an `oidc` key with the configured sign in
providers as submit fields:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/login/flows?id=26ac2d66-eeb7-42f3-8ba8-5fe70925d6a3' \
  | jq -r '.methods.oidc.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/auth/7430f336-0be0-47d1-b1fc-5cc6fcc3f228",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "LJ3o59zXjukFs1004vyn3QrWDrfutW2e0Iaqo/9Ck6srYAceydRr59GEZJNFY6Walnell+r10/DlXUy/Eq6sXQ=="
    },
    {
      "name": "provider",
      "type": "submit",
      "value": "github"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Login Flow Form Rendering

The Login User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application (server,
native app, single page app) that should render a login form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Login Flow JSON response to render the login form UI, which
could looks as follows depending on your programming language and web framework:

<RenderFlow flow="login" />

## Login Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to ORY Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Login UI for Browser Clients.
- An `application/json` response for API Clients.

### Login with Username/Email and Password

To complete the login, the end-user fills out their identifier (username, email,
phone number, ...) and the password. Possible validation errors include a
missing identifier or password, or invalid credentials:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodPasswordWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect
to the Login Flow UI, containing the Login Flow ID which includes the error
payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the
Login Flow in the response payload as JSON.

### Login with Google, Facebook, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

Completing the `oidc` method requires the user to go through an OAuth 2.0 or
OpenID Connect flow which involves logging into the upstream identity provider
(e.g. Google) and giving consent.

:::note

If the user has never signed in with the given provider before, a new account
will be created. It is also possible to link upstream identities (e.g. Google
profile) with an existing ORY Kratos identity.

:::

A possible validation error is a missing ID Token:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodOidcWithErrors} />

## Successful Login

Completing the login behaves differently for Browser and API Clients.

### Browser Clients

When the login is completed successfully, ORY Kratos responds with a HTTP 302
Redirect to the
[configured redirect URL](../../concepts/browser-redirect-flow-completion).
Alongside the HTTP 302 Redirect is a `Set-Cookie` header which contains the ORY
Kratos Login Session Cookie:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Cache-Control: 0
Location: http://127.0.0.1:4455/
Set-Cookie: csrf_token=b8OebRPTPr5ow23mA5gIZmFNLeuMbv8pZz1jT1Ex7ys=; Path=/; Domain=127.0.0.1; Max-Age=31536000; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: ory_kratos_session=MTU5OTE2ODc2N3xEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR055VlROMGRteHhSakJrUzBkbmRUUjBlVFY1V0RCRWFVTnJXVmR6V25oaHx2DICsB6IMbaHSQwnYITUZqr7Qx7CxUlnaneJWH495wQ==; Path=/; Expires=Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:32:47 GMT; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
Vary: Cookie
Date: Thu, 03 Sep 2020 21:32:47 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

Now, whenever the browser is making a request (with cookies) to the
`http://127.0.0.1/sessions/whoami` endpoint, the session will be returned:

```shell script
curl -s -H "Cookie: ory_kratos_session=MTU5OTE2ODc2N3xEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR055VlROMGRteHhSakJrUzBkbmRUUjBlVFY1V0RCRWFVTnJXVmR6V25oaHx2DICsB6IMbaHSQwnYITUZqr7Qx7CxUlnaneJWH495wQ==" \

    ]
  }
}
```

### API Clients

For API Clients, ORY Kratos responds with a JSON payload which includes the
identity which just authenticated, the session, and the ORY Kratos Session
Token:

```shell script
# Inits a Login Flow
$ actionUrl=$(\
  curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api" \
    | jq -r '.methods.password.config.action'\
)

# Complete Login Flow with password method
$ curl -s -X POST -H  "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"identifier": "api@user.org", "password": "iohuasf0897zAJHf"}' \
    "$actionUrl" | jq

          "via": "email"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The ORY Kratos Session Token can be checked at the
`http://127.0.0.1/sessions/whoami` endpoint:

```shell script
$ curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer svX8bE9HTiVpMr7r55TtKtcOkLRhAq1a" \

        "via": "email"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Refreshing a Session

In some cases it is required to refresh a login session. This is the case when
updating one's password. Refreshing a session updates the `authenticated_at`
time.

:::info

Refreshing a session will not log the user out, unless another user signs in.

:::

To refresh a session, append `?refresh=true` to:

- `/self-service/login/browser` for browser Clients (e.g.
  `http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser?refresh=true`)
- `/self-service/login/api` for API Clients (e.g.
  `http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api?refresh=true`)

## Hooks

ORY Kratos allows you to configure hooks that run before and after a Login Flow.
This may be helpful if you'd like to restrict logins to IPs coming from your
internal network or other logic.

For more information about hooks please read the [Hook Documentation](../hooks).
